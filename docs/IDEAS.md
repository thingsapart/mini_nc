## CPAP/Roborock Push-Pull dust extraction and chip blower

Cyclone dust/chip extractor based on a CPAP or Robrock vacuum/blower. Hook up the input port for extraction, the output port for chip blowing and/or misting.

Half of the dust shoe is detachable and held via magnets, the alterantive would be to have two "dust shoe attachments" - one for blowing config, the other for vacuuming.
